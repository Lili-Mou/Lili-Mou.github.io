	<li>Passion for scientific research (motivation, curiosity, persistence, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<br/>
<h3>For UofA undergraduate and Master's students looking for supervisors:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Please contact me.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For applicants to the Master's program:</h3>	
<ul>
	<li>The application should be addressed to the University <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions" target="_blank">portal</a>.</li>

		<li>are recommended by a researcher who I know, or</li>
		<li>have top-tier publications.</li>
	</ul>
Then, we may chat with a test of basic <b>math</b> and machine learning knowledge,<br/> 
and a discussion of the scientific value of various research directions.<br/>
	
If you do not meet the above criteria, your email may not be replied due to my time constraints.
