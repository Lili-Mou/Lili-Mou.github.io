<h1>CMPUT 466/566: Machine Learning</h1>
<h3>Fall 2020</h3>
<h3>Instructor: Lili Mou</h3>

<div>

<p width=200px>
<h3>Course Format </h3> The course will be delivered remotely. UofA members (for credit or auditing) enjoy a private Google Meet lecture room, QA sessions with the instructor and TAs, as well as other social events. <br/><br/>

<ul>
<li>Prerequisites will not be waived for crediting.</li>
<li>The course is full at this moment for students taking for credit. To be listed on the waiting list, the student needs to send an email to explain his/her math and programming background (courses taken since college study). If satsifactory, the instructor will ask the student to fill in a Google Form. If selected, the instructor will send an email to the student. Notice that the chance of enrollment is considered as very low. </li>
<li>Official auditing is always welcome. Just send the audit form to the instructor.</li>
<li>Unofficial sitting through the course is also welcome, and you can find the information on this page.</li>
<li>Adding to eClass is possible for UofA members (students and staff). Just send an email to the instructor.</li>
<li>For non-UofA members, you would not be able to access eClass. But lectures are open accessible to anyone who has Internet access.</li>

<h3>Lecture time:</h3> 12:30 PM -- 1:50 PM, Tuesday and Thursday, 1-Sep-2020 ~ 7-Dec-2020

<h3>Course Description</h3>

Machine learning teaches a machine to learn from previous experience and makes a prediction for (possibly new) data. This course covers standard materials of a “Machine Learning” course, such as linear regression, linear classification, as well as non-linear models. In the process, we will have a systematic discussion on training criteria, inference criteria, bias-variance tradeoff, etc. The goal of the course is to build a solid foundation of machine learning, so there would be intensive math derivations in lectures, assignments, and exams.
