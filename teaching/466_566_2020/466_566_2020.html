Since I release all materials on my homepage, there is no point in being added to eclass.<br/> 
	Manually adding every unofficial auditing student to eclass takes too much time for me.
<h3>Course format</h3>
The instructor will derive everything on the whiteboard. No slides would be used. <br/>
No official textbook is designated, but the instructor will provide lecture notes and <br/>
	point to materials for further reading. 
	
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Basic math (including algebra, calculus, probability theory, and statistics)</li>
	<li>Coding skills. The students should be able to write code in at least one programming <br/>
		language, although the programming assignments would be in python.</li>
</ul>
<b>No</b> machine learning background is required, as this could serve as the first course in machine learning.

<h3>Grading Schema</h3>
<b>Undergraduate students:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Written assignments: 10%</li>
	<li>Coding assignments: 10%</li>
	<li>Small project: 10% (Do something for something)<br/> + 5% bonus for a non-trivial project</li>
	<li>Mid-term (closed book): 30%</li>
	<li>Final (closed book): 40%</li>
	</ul>
<b>Graduate students:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Written assignments: 5%</li>
	<li>Coding assignments: 10%</li>
	<li>Course project: 10% for doing something for something<br/> + 5%  for a non-trivial project</li>
		<li>Mid-term (closed book): 30%</li>
		<li>Final (closed book): 40%</li>
	</ul>

Note:
<ul>
	<li>This course focuses on paper-based derivation instead of programming. </li>
	<li>To avoid any disputation of marking, written assignments will be graded by<br/> 
			a binary score for each problem. 1=a serious attempt, 0=otherwise. </li>
	<li>For coding assignments and exams, a student can appeal for the marks only due to<br/> 
		scientific reasons (e.g., comments are significantly, factually wrong). A student<br/>
		cannot dispute for partial mark deduction if the solution has an error. (Theoretically,<br/> no partial
			marks should be given for wrong answers. If there were any partial marks,<br/> they would
			reflect TA's or the instructor's courtesy.)</li>
	<li>The final letter grade will be given by some cut-off based on numerical marks. Assuming<br/> 
			a student does reasonably well in all assignments and the course project, then the letter<br/>
			grades roughly maps to the following criteria:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>A+ = The student well understands lecture materials and can generalize to new problems.</li>
			<li>A = The student well understands lecture materials but is unable to generalize to new problems.</li>
			<li>A- = The student understands most part of the lecture materials, but a few details are missing.</li>
			<li>B+ = The student understands some part of the lecture materials, but a significant portion are missing.</li>
			<li>B   = The student has some qualitative/philosophical understanding of lecture materials, but does only a little quantitative derivation.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
